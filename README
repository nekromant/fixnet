Ever being tired that android has a shitty way to set the hostname as
android_someshittyhex? Does your china-originated tablet give you a 
random mac each boot time?
Well, this is the solution. Requires busybox and root though. 
It sets the mac and the hostname at boot, so that your dhcp server on
the router can properly handle this device.
